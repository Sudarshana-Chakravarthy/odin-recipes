    <h4>How to Make Biryani</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a hot pressure cooker or a heavy bottom pot</li>
        <li>Next add bay leaf, star anise, shahi jeera, cloves, cardamoms & cinnamon. Saute for 1 to 2 mins.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions and slit green chilies. Fry them stirring often until the onions turn evenly golden or
            light brown.</li>
        <li>Next add ginger garlic paste and saute for about a minute or until the raw smell has gone off.</li>
        <li>Add all the chopped vegetables and fry for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next add tomatoes, ⅛ teaspoon salt, yogurt, coriander leaves, mint leaves,red chilli powder, turmeric and
            garam masala.</li>
        <li>Mix all of these and fry on a high flame for 2 to 3 mins. The tomatoes
            should break down completely and the raw smell disappear.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce the flame to low. Drain the water from the rice completely and
            spread it in a layer evenly over the veggies.
        </li>
        <li>Measure the water or coconut milk to a separate bowl & add ¼ tsp
            salt. Mix well and taste the water. It has to be slightly salty. Bring the
            water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Pour the salted water across the sides or edges of the pot</li>
        <li>If you do not mix up everything then the veg biryani will cook in layers.
            (However you can also mix up everything and cook just like it is done
            normally.)
        </li>
        <li> Cover the cooker and pressure cook for 1
            whistle on a medium high flame.Turn off the stove. For al dente non
            mushy veg biryani, I release the pressure manually after 1 to 2 mins
            using a wooden spatula. When the pressure releases, open the lid
            and fluff up veg biryani with a fork.
        </li>

    </ol>
