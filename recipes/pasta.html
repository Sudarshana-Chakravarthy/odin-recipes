    <p>This White Sauce Pasta is an easy weeknight meal that’s ready under 30 minutes. You will love this rich, creamy &
        saucy White Pasta, perfectly seasoned with Italian herbs & topped with red chili flakes. It is lighter and not
        heavy and is a satisfying vegetarian comfort food. You can make this plain or with mixed vegetables, chicken or
        shrimp according to your preference.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (100 grams) pasta
            (penne or macaroni)
        </li>
        <li>4 cups water
            to boil pasta</li>

        <li>1½ cup milk</li>

        <li>1½ tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter
            + ½ tablespoon to sauté veggies</li>

        <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon oregano
        </li>

        <li>salt</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon red chilli flakes
        </li>

        <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>¼ cup carrots</li>
        <li>¼ cup broccoli or green peas</li>
        <li>¼ cup bell peppers</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Boil Pasta: Bring water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add salt and
            pasta. Cook till al dente on a medium high flame. Read instructions on
            package for timings.</li>
        <li> Drain Pasta: Reserve ¼ cup pasta stock and drain the pasta to a
            colander. Cover and keep aside.
        </li>

        <li>Saute Veggies: Pour ½ tbsp butter to a pan and saute vegetables
            until slightly tender yet crunchy, for 5 to 6 mins. Remove to a plate
            and set aside</li>

        <li>Make the sauce: Melt 2 tablespoons butter on a medium heat and fry
            garlic for 30 to 40 seconds. Stir in all-purpose flour and saute well
            until the flour loses the raw smell, for about a minute.
        </li>

        <li>Turn off the heat/stove and slowly whisk in ½ cup milk into the roux.
            Keep whisking till it looks creamy & uniform to prevent forming lumps.</li>

        <li>Pour the rest of the milk and whisk/stir well. Turn on the stove, cook
            on a medium-low stirring often, scraping the sides, until the white
            sauce becomes thick.
        </li>

        <li>Stir in the heavy cream or cheese. The white sauce is done perfectly
            when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Alternately you
            can draw a finger/line through the coated spoon. The sauce should
            wipe clean and leave a space, meaning it is thick enough.</li>

        <li>Stir in the vegetables, cooked pasta, pepper, oregano (or mixed
            Italian herbs) and chili flakes. If the sauce looks too thick (as it cools
            down), add 2 tbsps of the reserved stock so the sauce loosens a bit.
        </li>

        <li>Garnish white sauce pasta with red chilli flakes and crushed black
            pepper. Serve it hot or warm as the sauce thickens more when it
            cools down.</li>

    </ol>
